California Housing Prices

[### Project Data Science Predicting Housing Prices : Project overview](https://github.com/MartinNde/MartinN_1)


Predict the housing prices of California using Linear Regression Model. 
The dataset which was taken from Kraggle(https://www.kaggle.com/code/shibumohapatra/linear-regression-and-rmse). 
This is then save in MongoDB where it is retrieve for the analysis.
It is import to understand that the original dataset is not altered in MongoDB only the copy that was taken out is manipulated.
Meaning that is anything goes wrong with the dataset, the original version will still be in tact.


The process of collecting the dataset from MongoDB is represented in the screenshot below,
The dataset is in a CSV file. This is first imported and MongoClient is imported from pymongo.

Using the logon details generated by MongoDB, python is then connected to MongoDB to retrive the data which appear in pythong in the format shown below. This is done using the article and collection function and the print function as shown in the screenshot.

## Linear Regression

For the linear regression process to begin, the necessary packages needs to be imported. All the relevant libraries and packages are then imported as follows:

# Importing and viewing the head of the dataframe

The dataset is now impported into the model and viewed intothe dataframe. 
This is to obtain a perspective of the data and see if all the information in the data has been correctly included.

## viewing the information on the dataframe and also get the discription of the data.

This is done using the two short and simple functions of info and describe as shown below:
